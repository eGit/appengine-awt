<p>
  <ul>
      <li>Add a structured way to write IPTC image metadata to JPEG files.</li>

      <li>Share test image suite with comments.</li>
      <li>Improve Javadoc and write more FAQs / examples.</li>

      <li>Add support for more than 8 bits per channel.</li>
      <li>Reading all images from .gif files isn't working. see: getAllBufferedImages().</li>
      <li>Add request/hint params to ImageFactory, per Endre's suggestion.</li>
      <li>Add DNG metadata/image info read. Perhaps some RAW formats as well.</li>
      <li>Publish image library (possibly) and links to other libraries.</li>
