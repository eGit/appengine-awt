<section name="Why use Sanselan?">

<p>
  <ul>
      <li>This library is Free Software/Open Source. It is available under the <a href="license.html">Apache Software License</a>.</li>
      <li>Sanselan is pure-Java. It will run on any jvm, on any platform without modification. It has no dependencies. Sanselan only requires Java 1.4 or later.</li>
      <li>Sanselan is easy to use. It has a simple, clean interface. Most operations are a single Sanselan method call. See our Sample Code for examples.</li>
      <li>The core functionality is reading and writing a variety of image formats. See the list of Supported Formats.</li>
      <li>Sanselan supports a number of format variations and uncommon features not supported by other image libraries.</li>
      <li>Sanselan does more than read and write images. Reading image info (image size, colorspace, bit depth, etc.) and metadata is easy and does not require reading the entire image.</li>
      <li>Sanselan supports reading and writing a variety of metadata in a structured way, including EXIF metadata.</li>
      <li>Sanselan provides a consistent api across a variety of image formats.</li>
      <li>Sanselan is network-aware. Sanselan will only read the data it needs. Reading most image info and metadata only requires reading a header.</li>
      <li>Sanselan was written with an eye to correctness and code clarity rather than efficiency.</li>
      <li>Sanselan can extract and (simply) parse embedded ICC Profiles. Moreover, Sanselan applies the icc profile by default, coverting read images to sRGB.
          This means images are color-corrected by default. see:

      </li>
      <li>Sanselan is actively maintained.</li>
